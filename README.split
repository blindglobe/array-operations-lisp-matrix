I have reorganized parts of FFA that do not make use of CFFI into a
separate package, ARRAY-OPERATIONS in July, 2008.

The tutorial for this package is still in the FFA package, in the
documentation subdirectory, because the two packages are closely
related.  Nevertheless, if you just need array operations, you should
use ARRAY-OPERATIONS as it does not depend on CFFI.
